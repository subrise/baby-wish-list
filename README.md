# Baby Wish List

[Baby Wish List](http://babylist.sammy.nu/) is a simple wishlist manager wich allows your friends to reserve an item on your wishlist anonymously.

Because of time constraints, the project will be smaller than originally planned. At first I wanted to create a service where people could create their own lists and invite friends over. But, I just didn't had the time or energy to complete it. So I have decided to work with only 1 list.

Also still not sure if an installation script will ever come. I guess I will have less time when the baby is here.

#Required

This project makes use of [Kohana PHP Framework](http://kohanaframework.org/). I'm planning on creating an install script, but I just want to give a heads up incase you want to fork this repo already.

## Kohana PHP Framework

[Kohana](http://kohanaframework.org/) is an elegant, open source, and object oriented HMVC framework built using PHP5, by a team of volunteers. It aims to be swift, secure, and small.

Released under a [BSD license](http://kohanaframework.org/license), Kohana can be used legally for any open source, commercial, or personal project.

### Documentation
Kohana's documentation can be found at <http://kohanaframework.org/documentation> which also contains an API browser.

The `userguide` module included in all Kohana releases also allows you to view the documentation locally. Once the `userguide` module is enabled in the bootstrap, it is accessible from your site via `/index.php/guide` (or just `/guide` if you are rewriting your URLs).
